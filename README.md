# Library

## Description
This is a small library app that helps the user keep track of their books.
## Motivation
The motivation behind starting this project was to familiarize myself with creating javascript objects, as well as working with inheritance. 
## Features
Add Book Section
* In this section you can enter all the information about the book. When you are finished press submit to add the book to your list.

My Reading List Section
* In this section you can view all the books you have added to your list. Additionally, you can update the read status as well as delete entries.

Storage
*   When you are finished you can close the site and a copy of your list will be saved locally to your computer. The next time you visit the site your list will automatically be uploaded.
* For this to work you must use the same browser and computer. You can even save the website and work on your list offline.
## Lessons Learned
* I learned how to use JS in combination with CSS classes to hide body element instead of add and removing them.
* I learned how to use localStorage to store, retrieve, and parse data, allowing the persistence of user data.
* I learned how to store and retrieve data in objects to keep code organized.
